## Title

Computational workflow for Emerging 2D carbon Allotropes: A Focus on Electronic Properties

## Abstract

The proposed workflow will incorporate several building blocks and crystal symmetries from a known database. The workflow will span through retrieving crystal prototypes from the database, standardizing the file formats, conducting global optimization using the first-principle calculation, and investigating electronic properties. Utilizing the generated plots, a systematic classification of the novel 2D carbon materials will be performed, categorizing them as topological insulators, Weyl semimetals, or Dirac semimetals, depending on factors such as the building blocks, symmetry breakings, and space groups.
